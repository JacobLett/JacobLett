# Digital Marketing & Web Design Specialist
## Jacob Lett

Hi my name is Jacob. I have been a web designer / developer for the past 10+ years. I am still learning and enjoy helping others learn as well. I have worked in various corporate settings and as a freelancer.

I earned a [bachelors in graphic design](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacoblett/?utm_source=github-profile) around the time CSS and web standards were just starting to take hold. My primary focus was print design but gradually began doing more web projects. Then in 2009 I got my first job as a web developer writing a ton of CSS and realizing I had a long journey of learning ahead.

In addition to web design and frontend development, I have experience with SEO, PPC, Google Analytics, email marketing, and creating digital products to earn side income. I have primarily focused on marketing based web development to build landing pages, email templates, CMS themes, and branding third party sites.

I am currently trying to improve my skills with JavaScript and backend technologies so that I am able to build my own web applications from scratch.

Technologies I enjoy working with include: HubSpot CMS, WordPress CMS, Shopify, Bootstrap 5, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript.
